# EasyFeh 

A straight-forward & user-friendly wrapper for [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh), written in Python :)

## Features üòé

- A wallpaper history , allows you to move forward or backward in history
- Highly customizable
- Allows users to fetch wallpapers from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/)
- Also works in wayland but uses [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww) instead of feh by default
- Users can use any linux-tool if they don't want to use swww or feh

## Dependencies

The dependencies include: 

- [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh)

- [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww) (Optional, only if you're on wayland)

- [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

- [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/)

- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

Although the dependencies will be automatically installed while installing the application, if you still want to install these dependencies manually, you can checkout the `requirements.txt` file. and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
If you want to use something other than feh or swww, you can do that by enabling `other` in the configuration file, and setting the cmd parameter

If you're on Arch Linux, like me, then you can install it from the AUR:
```bash
paru -S easyfeh
```
Make sure to replace `paru` with whatever AUR helper you use.

For other distros try (installs locally to the user):
```bash
python setup.py install --user
```
if you want to install it systemwide, you can try:
```bash
sudo python setup.py install
```

If your distro allows python package installation directly using pip,
You can install EasyFeh by cloning this repository locally.
Here's the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShibamRoy9826/easyfeh.git
cd easyfeh
pip install .
```
That's it! read the usage of the commands and enjoy!

## Configuration üõ†Ô∏è

The configuration file for EasyFeh can be found at `$HOME/.config/easyfeh/config.toml`

> [!NOTE]
> Please configure the wallpaper_directory parameter, it will not work well otherwise, it doesn't have filetype checks yet, so it might pick up a non-image file as wallpaper when it tries to find a random wallpaper

Its well-commented with explaination of each parameter. Here's the default configuration file of EasyFeh

```text
[wallpaper]
wallpaper_directory= "/home/{username}/Pictures"
random = false # sets random wallpapers from wallpaper_directory
remember_wallpaper = true # Saves to history 
wallpaper_history_limit = 50 # history limit, history resets automatically once this limit exceeds

[internet]
use_from_internet = false
image_source = "unsplash" # "unsplash"(default) or "wallhaven"
wallpaper_save_directory = "/home/{username}/Pictures/easyfeh"
image_query = "landscape" # Search for images you want, default is "landscape" 
shuffle_results = true # Recommended, else, it will always lead to the same result(The first search result) , only valid for unsplash results
wallhaven_purity = "sfw" # Only if wallhaven is selected as image source. Options: "sfw", "nsfw"
use_saved = true # Also includes already downloaded images from the internet when -random is called

[triggers]
notify_on_change = false # sends a notification on wallpaper change
command_on_change = false # runs a command on wallpaper change, you can use it to run scripts
notif_message = "Wallpaper Changed!" # Notification heading (only if notify_on_change is turned on)
notif_body = "Wallpaper has been set to :f: " # Notification body (only if notify_on_change is turned on), :f: get's replaced by the image's path
command = "" # Set only if command_on_change is turned on

[feh]
options = "--bg-fill" # Feh options

[swww]
# Only if you're using wayland
options = ""

[other]
enabled = false
# If you want to use something other than feh or swww
cmd = ""
# Example: command -options :f: 
#    :f: get's replaced by the image path

[internal]
# Current Wallpaper index in the history
wall_index = -1
```
