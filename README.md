# EasyFeh 

A straight-forward & user-friendly wrapper originally meant for [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh), but works with any other wallpaper engine too!

written with ‚ù§Ô∏è in Python :)

## Features üòé

- A wallpaper history , allows you to move forward or backward in history
- Highly customizable
- Allows users to fetch wallpapers from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/)
- Also works in wayland but uses [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww) instead of feh by default
- Users can use any other wallpaper engine if they don't want to use swww or feh
- It can generated palettes from the current wallpaper

Although the dependencies will be automatically installed while installing the application, if you still want to install these dependencies manually, you can checkout the `requirements.txt` file. and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
If you want to use something other than feh or swww, you can do that by enabling `other` in the configuration file, and setting the cmd parameter

If you're on Arch Linux, like me, then you can install it from the AUR:
```bash
paru -S easyfeh
```

There's also a development version to check out the latest changes:
```bash
paru -S easyfeh-git
```
Make sure to replace `paru` with whatever AUR helper you use.

For other distros try (installs locally to the user):
```bash
python setup.py install --user
```
if you want to install it systemwide, you can try:
```bash
sudo python setup.py install
```

If your distro allows python package installation directly using pip,
You can install EasyFeh by cloning this repository locally.
Here's the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShibamRoy9826/easyfeh.git
cd easyfeh
pip install .
```
That's it! read the usage of the commands and enjoy!

The configuration file for EasyFeh can be found at `$HOME/.config/easyfeh/config.toml`

> [!NOTE]
> Its recommended to configure the wallpaper_directory so that its easier to set your desired wallpapers

Its well-commented with explaination of each parameter. Here's the default configuration file of EasyFeh

```text
